This library is no longer maintained.

Since this package is just a simple http client for jsnice.org it should continue to work as long as they do not change the API.

However, I am not associated with jsnice.org in any way, which means if you encounter any issues with parsing/rendering of javascript you will have to reach the people at jsnice.org directly.

My apologizes for any inconvenience.
